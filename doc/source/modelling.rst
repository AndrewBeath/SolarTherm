Modelling
=========

PDEs
----
OpenModelica can only solve ODEs directly so one of a number of different approximation methods will be required for any PDEs:

* Finite difference method
* Finite element method
* Finite volume method
* Weak form

Discrete Events
---------------
Have to make sure the number of equations is equal to the number of variables at all times.
